### API 1
My first API is a put called UpdateUser. It can be used to change any or all aspects of a user that is already in the database including first name, last name, and contact information.

### API 2
My second API is a get called GetAllPlantsByLocation. It allows the user to type in a location Id, which is a foreign key to the plant table, and then displays all off the plants native to that location.
